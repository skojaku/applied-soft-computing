# Basic Information

Welcome to the course on Applied Soft Computing! This course introduces you to the emerging field of computational intelligence, a distinct approach to machine intelligence that diverges from traditional AI. The course encompasses artificial neural networks, evolutionary computing, and probabilistic reasoning.

Our aim is to provide a succinct overview of the fundamental concepts by working with practical applications. The course involves coding activities, and fluency in Python is strongly encouraged.
